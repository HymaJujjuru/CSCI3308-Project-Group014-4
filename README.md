# Study Bytes
This application is a campus study group website that displays local study groups happening on or near campus in Boulder. This website is intended to address the problem of finding/being aware of study groups to join on campus. Our target audience is students, and the functionality is to inform/advertise study groups through an easy user interface, with an option to search for specific study groups based on filtering options.

There are 6 different user interfaces for the user to navigate through. The first is the main Study Bytes page, which will prompt the user to either login or sign up for an account. Either option will lead to a pop-up menu for the user to enter their information for registering or signing in. After the user is signed in, a calendar view of general open study groups be displayed. The user has the option to navigate to the advanced events list, profile page, or log out via a navigation bar at the top of the page. The Events pages will list the available study sessions for students to add to their calendars to save the dates. The Profile page allows users to view their events and modify user details. The final navigation bar option "log out" will just log the user out of the application and take them back to the main Study Bytes page, which will again prompt the user to log in or sign up for an account.

# Vision Statement
A website for the amazing students of Boulder where they can find the study groups organized for them.
