# Event Bytes
A campus event website that will display local events happening on or near campus based on your interests, area, and price (optional). This website is intended to address the problem of finding/being aware of things to do on campus. Our target audience is students, and the functionality would be to inform/advertise events on-campus or local events through an easy user interface, with maybe an option to switch to specific areas of campus (or off campus) to display specific events planned for those areas.

# Vision Statement
A website for the amazing students of Boulder where they can find the events organized for them.
